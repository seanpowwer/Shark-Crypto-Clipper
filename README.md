# Shark Crypto Clipper 
[video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNOJyp-nMPM&t=8s]
# The most powerful RAT interceptor for crypto payments as of 2023

# Completely open source

# The first thing you agree with using this tool is that I do not bear any responsibility for your subsequent actions, if you are not sure about something, then do not take this job.

The first thing you should do is check the keys

The password / key you entered at login must match the builder key

If your login key and builder don't match you won't get a connection

# If you find errors, if you can't compile the project, then write questions, I will answer you
